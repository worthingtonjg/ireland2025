  caption: "Founded around 1030 by the Norse King Sitric Silkenbeard, Christ Church Cathedral is the spiritual heart of medieval Dublin. It was rebuilt in stone after the Norman invasion and has stood for centuries as both a religious center and architectural marvel. Beneath its floors lies a large medieval crypt — one of the oldest structures in the city — which once held relics, manuscripts, and even a mummified cat and rat. Today, the cathedral is still active and is undergoing preservation, as seen here with restoration work in progress."

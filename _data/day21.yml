  caption: "There’s a forest in Ireland they call Coill na Ceilte — the “Hidden Wood. Most people don’t go in after dark."

  caption: "The old people in town say fairies live there - but not the nice kind."

  caption: "They say if you hear a child laughing deep in the woods after sunset… Don’t follow it."

  caption: "A girl named Orla lived near the edge of that forest. She was 13 — curious, brave, and a little too bold."
- src: /photos/day21/Image06.png
  caption: "She wandered alone often, searching for mushrooms and old stones. Her mam always warned her…"

  caption: "“If you hear laughter in the woods and it sounds like a child… But you can’t see them…”"
- src: /photos/day21/Image08.png
  caption: "“You turn around. Because what you hear isn’t human anymore.”"

  caption: "But Orla laughed it off. “Fairy stories,” she said. “I’m not afraid.”"

  caption: "Then one foggy evening…"
- src: /photos/day21/Image11.png
  caption: "Orla heard it. A giggle — light and playful — drifting between the trees."
- src: /photos/day21/Image12.png
  caption: "It sounded like a child, playing hide-and-seek."
- src: /photos/day21/Image13.png
  caption: "She followed it. Of course she did. Step by step… deeper into the woods."
- src: /photos/day21/Image14.png
  caption: "The trees twisted. The air turned cold. The giggling grew louder."
- src: /photos/day21/Image15.png
  caption: "But still… she saw no one."
- src: /photos/day21/Image16.png
  caption: "Then — a clearing. A ring of mushrooms. A fairy ring."
- src: /photos/day21/Image17.png
  caption: "And in the center… stood a girl."
- src: /photos/day21/Image18.png
  caption: "She looked exactly like Orla. Same hoodie. Same eyes. Same freckle on her chin."
- src: /photos/day21/Image19.png
  caption: "“You’ve come,” the copy said, grinning too wide. “You can rest now. I’ll go back for you.”"
- src: /photos/day21/Image20.png
  caption: "Orla turned to run. But her feet were rooted to the moss."
- src: /photos/day21/Image21.png
  caption: "The girl stepped out of the ring. The real Orla vanished."
- src: /photos/day21/Image22.png
  caption: "When her parents found “Orla” the next morning… She seemed the same."
- src: /photos/day21/Image23.png
  caption: "…Except her voice was just a little too sweet. And at night, her eyes glowed faintly green in the dark."
- src: /photos/day21/Image24.png
  caption: "To this day… they say if you step into a fairy ring at twilight, you might trade places without knowing it. And somewhere, deep in the woods… the real Orla is still calling out. But only the wind hears her."

  caption: "To comfort the children, King Lir remarried—a beautiful woman named Aoife."

  caption: "At first, Aoife was kind and loving, a gentle presence in the royal household."

  caption: "Consumed by envy, Aoife plotted a terrible fate for the children."

  caption: "\"You will wander the lakes and seas of Ireland for 900 years,\" she declared."

  caption: "\"Three hundred years on Lough Derravaragh, three on the Sea of Moyle, and three at Inish Glora.\""

  caption: "The swans cried out in despair, their human voices still intact."

  caption: "When Lir discovered the curse, he was heartbroken—but powerless to undo it."

  caption: "Aoife was banished forever, her punishment to live as a demon in the air."

  caption: "The children remained near their home on Lough Derravaragh for the first 300 years."

  caption: "There they sang to passersby, their sorrowful songs echoing across the water."

  caption: "As centuries passed, forests grew and kings fell, but the swans endured."

  caption: "After 300 years, they flew north to the cold and stormy Sea of Moyle."
- src: /photos/day04/image19.png
  caption: "There, the waves were wild and harsh, and the swans clung together to survive."
- src: /photos/day04/image20.png
  caption: "Lightning split the skies, and they endured bitter loneliness on that northern sea."

  caption: "Still, they had each other and the memory of their father’s love."

  caption: "After another 300 years, they flew west to Inish Glora, a desolate island off the coast."
- src: /photos/day04/image23.png
  caption: "Time passed, and the old gods faded as the new faith of Christianity came to Ireland."

  caption: "A kind monk named Caomhán discovered them and listened to their tale."
- src: /photos/day04/image25.png
  caption: "With his blessing, the final years of their sentence came to a peaceful end."
- src: /photos/day04/image26.png
  caption: "The moment the curse lifted, they transformed—no longer swans, but fragile old humans."
- src: /photos/day04/image27.png
  caption: "The monk baptized them, and they died peacefully, free at last from their enchantment."
- src: /photos/day04/image28.png
  caption: "He buried them together in one grave, their souls finally at rest."

  caption: "Tullynally—Tulaigh an Eallaigh, the Hill of the Swan—still watches over the lake today."

  caption: "The grounds whisper the tale, carried on the wind and in the water."

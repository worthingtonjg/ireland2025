  caption: "Long ago, in the mists of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, there lived a druid named Éireamhón."

  caption: "Éireamhón was the last of his kind—keeper of ancient wisdom and the secrets of stone and stream."
- src: /photos/day11/Image63.png
  caption: "He wandered Glenbarrow’s woods, listening to the river’s voice and the whispers of trees."
- src: /photos/day11/Image64.png
  caption: "Legends say the waterfall was his sacred spring, guarded by spirits of air and water."

  caption: "Each morning, he cast runes on the smooth rocks to read the world’s fate."

  caption: "One day, a black mist crept over the valley, and the animals fled in silence."

  caption: "A stranger had come—cloaked in shadow and riding a horse without hooves."
- src: /photos/day11/Image68.png
  caption: "This was the Fomhórach, a creature of chaos, banished to the underworld long ago."
- src: /photos/day11/Image69.png
  caption: "The Fomhórach sought the spring, whose waters granted visions of the future."

  caption: "Éireamhón stood at the waterfall’s edge, staff in hand, vowing to protect it."
- src: /photos/day11/Image71.png
  caption: "He called upon the spirits of the glen—fox, raven, ash, and fern—to aid him."
- src: /photos/day11/Image72.png
  caption: "The river rose, rushing with power as if it, too, defied the shadow’s claim."
- src: /photos/day11/Image73.png
  caption: "For three days and nights, the sky darkened as the druid and the Fomhórach clashed."

  caption: "Lightning struck the hills, splitting trees and sending echoes through the bogs."
- src: /photos/day11/Image75.png
  caption: "At last, Éireamhón tricked the creature, casting it into a cave sealed by stone."
- src: /photos/day11/Image76.png
  caption: "The entrance, they say, is still hidden somewhere near the upper loop trail."
- src: /photos/day11/Image77.png
  caption: "As the mist cleared, the land sighed in relief, and the birds returned to sing."
- src: /photos/day11/Image78.png
  caption: "Éireamhón, drained but victorious, vanished into the forest, never seen again."
- src: /photos/day11/Image79.png
  caption: "Some say he became part of the river, his spirit flowing with its current forever."

  caption: "Others claim a red fox that watches hikers is Éireamhón’s guardian form."
- src: /photos/day11/Image81.png
  caption: "On foggy mornings, hikers sometimes hear chanting near the falls—soft and low."
- src: /photos/day11/Image82.png
  caption: "The waterfall, now called the Druid’s Well by locals, still flows with ancient energy."
- src: /photos/day11/Image83.png
  caption: "Those who drink from it claim to dream of stars, oak trees, and forgotten names."
- src: /photos/day11/Image84.png
  caption: "Children are told not to stray from the path, lest they stumble upon the sleeping Fomhórach."
- src: /photos/day11/Image85.png
  caption: "But for those who walk the loop with respect, the glen offers peace and memory."
- src: /photos/day11/Image86.png
  caption: "And so the legend lives on—carried in the breeze, carved in stone, and rushing through Glenbarrow."

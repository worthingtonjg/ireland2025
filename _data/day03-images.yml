  caption: Robert Rochfort, born in 1708, was heir to wealth and title—soon to become the 1st Earl of Belvedere.

  caption: Ambitious and powerful, Robert rose quickly in Irish society and gained a seat in Parliament.

  caption: In 1736, he married Mary Molesworth, a charming and educated 16-year-old from a noble family.

  caption: Their early marriage was joyful, filled with elegant dances, portraits, and poetry.

  caption: But Robert grew jealous and suspicious, especially of his own brothers, George and Arthur.
- src: /photos/day03/image07.png
  caption: He accused Mary of having an affair with Arthur—though there was no clear evidence.

  caption: In a fit of rage, Robert locked Mary in their home at Gaulstown House.

  caption: She was held under strict guard, servants forbidden to speak to her.
- src: /photos/day03/image10.png
  caption: Her children were barred from visiting. She was utterly alone.

  caption: For 31 years, Mary lived in isolation, denied any comfort or freedom.
- src: /photos/day03/image12.png
  caption: Her world shrank to four walls, where time and memory blurred.

  caption: Meanwhile, Robert sued his brother Arthur for adultery—a charge known as "criminal conversation."

  caption: Arthur couldn’t pay the enormous fine and was imprisoned in Dublin.
- src: /photos/day03/image15.png
  caption: He remained in debtor’s prison until his death, leaving his family destitute.

  caption: Robert, with his wealth intact, commissioned Belvedere House in 1740 as a display of power.
- src: /photos/day03/image17.png
  caption: Its Rococo ceilings and grand design reflected his taste—and ego.
- src: /photos/day03/image18.png
  caption: His brother George later built a larger home, Tudenham Park, nearby.  Furious at being overshadowed, Robert ordered the construction of the "Jealous Wall."
- src: /photos/day03/image20.png
  caption: It was a massive fake ruin, built solely to block the view of George’s estate.

  caption: The wall still stands as Ireland’s largest folly, born from envy and spite.
- src: /photos/day03/image22.png
  caption: Robert spent his later years in opulence, while Mary remained confined in obscurity.

  caption: In 1774, Robert died suddenly—some say mysteriously—while walking the grounds.

  caption: With Robert gone, his son George freed Mary after 31 long years.
- src: /photos/day03/image25.png
  caption: But freedom came too late—Mary was broken, frail, and confused.
- src: /photos/day03/image26.png
  caption: She no longer recognized her children and spoke to paintings as if they were friends.
- src: /photos/day03/image27.png
  caption: Eventually, she moved to France, where she entered a convent.
- src: /photos/day03/image28.png
  caption: Belvedere House changed hands, its beauty masking its cruel history.
- src: /photos/day03/image29.png
  caption: The Jealous Wall became a symbol of vanity, pain, and obsession.
- src: /photos/day03/image30.png
  caption: Today, visitors stroll the gardens, unaware of the tragedy that once unfolded here.

  caption: But if you listen closely, the story of the Wicked Earl and the imprisoned Lady still whispers in the stones.

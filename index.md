title: "30 Days in Ireland"
---

Welcome to my travel log of our 30-day adventure living in Ireland. My wife and daughter and I decided we wanted to spend a month exploring a new place and Ireland was the place we chose.

Our daily schedule is roughly as follows ...

Work Days:
- 6am - 4pm: Travel and visit closer places.
- 4pm - Midnight: Work (matches Utah office hours)
- Midnight - 6am: Sleep

Weekends:
- Use vacation days to take longer weekends
- Travel and visit places further away

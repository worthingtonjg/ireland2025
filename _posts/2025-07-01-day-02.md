  <figcaption>Going through customs was not what I expected, they simple stamped each passport and waved us on. Now we have to find baggage claim and see if our luggage made it to Ireland. I thought Dublin was an English speaking country, yet all of the signage is in Gaelic, then English.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>It sounds fast, but in reality that's just under 75 mph. 
Staying on the left hand side of the road is not the problem, passing oncoming traffic on roads so narrow you feel you need to suck-it-in is terrifying!</figcaption>

We took a break from sightseeing today and attended church at the branch in Mullingar. After the meeting, we spent the afternoon enjoying the peaceful Bloomfield Abbey Gardens and visited the historic Franciscan friary in Multyfarnham.

## Mullingar - Attended Church
Sunday morning was a quiet and meaningful part of our trip as we attended the local Latter-day Saint branch in Mullingar. The church met in a simple warehouse building, and there were about 20 members in attendance. Despite its modest setting, the spirit was strong and the small congregation was warm and welcoming. It was a humbling reminder of the global reach of our faith and the strength of small communities.

## Abby Bloom Gardens & Multyfarnham Friary
Later in the day, we walked through the Abbey Bloom Gardens, a serene and beautifully kept space filled with flowers, hedges, and reflective walking paths — a perfect place to slow down and enjoy a quiet afternoon. We then visited the Franciscan friary in Multyfarnham, one of Ireland’s best-preserved monastic sites. The friary dates back to the 13th century and has a calm, spiritual atmosphere, with stone cloisters, ancient tombs, and a sense of reverence that invites reflection. It was the perfect way to close a peaceful, restorative Sunday.

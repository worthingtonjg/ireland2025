After a full day of exploring Craggaunowen and Bunratty Castle yesterday, we decided to take a break from sightseeing and enjoy a slower pace today. Originally, we had planned to visit those two sites on separate days, but since we combined them, it gave us the perfect excuse to relax and recharge.

## A Slow Day at Home  
We slept in this morning and took our time making a late breakfast — no alarm clocks, no schedules, just a quiet, easy start to the day. Later, we took the dog down to the river and nearby park to run around and play, which was as much a break for us as it was for him. The weather was nice, and it felt good to spend some time outdoors without needing to be anywhere. We also caught up on some housekeeping: laundry, dishes, reorganizing the car a bit — all the small things that make a long trip more manageable. It was a quiet, ordinary day — and exactly what we needed.

After 24 unforgettable days exploring the rolling green hills, ancient ruins, and quiet beauty of Ireland, we traded mossy stone for city stone and hopped over to London for a change of pace. It was a bit of a jolt — from winding country roads to bustling double-decker traffic — but the energy of the city was contagious.

We planned for four days, knowing the first and last would be mostly spent in transit. That left us two full days to dive into the heart of London — and we made the most of it. Using a Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus pass, we crisscrossed the city from morning until night, taking in iconic sights from open rooftops and cobbled lanes alike.

This post is a collection of moments and impressions from all four days: snapshots from our arrival and departure, and a visual whirlwind of London in between. From Tower Bridge to Trafalgar Square, royal guards to red phone booths, we tried to see it all — and came away with full cameras, tired feet, and a deeper appreciation for this historic, ever-changing city.

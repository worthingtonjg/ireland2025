After 24 unforgettable days exploring the rolling green hills, ancient ruins, and quiet beauty of Ireland, we traded mossy stone for city stone and hopped over to London for a change of pace. It was a bit of a jolt — from winding country roads to bustling double-decker traffic — but the energy of the city was contagious.

We planned for four days, knowing the first and last would be mostly spent in transit. That left us two full days to dive into the heart of London — and we made the most of it. Using a Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus pass, we crisscrossed the city from morning until night, taking in iconic sights from open rooftops and cobbled lanes alike.

This post is a collection of moments and impressions from all four days: snapshots from our arrival and departure, and a visual whirlwind of London in between. From Tower Bridge to Trafalgar Square, royal guards to red phone booths, we tried to see it all — and came away with full cameras, tired feet, and a deeper appreciation for this historic, ever-changing city.

## Day 1 – Leaving Ireland, Landing in London
We said goodbye to Ireland with a mix of excitement and nostalgia, catching one last glimpse of green hills as we made our way to the airport. With just our carry-ons in tow, we navigated the Dublin Airport easily and boarded our Ryanair flight to London Gatwick. The flight was smooth and quick, offering a final overhead view of the Emerald Isle before the clouds took over. From Gatwick, we hopped on the train into London, gradually shifting from countryside to cityscape. By the time we reached our hotel in South Kensington, we were tired but happy — the adventure wasn’t over, just changing shape. London waited outside our window, full of possibility.

## Day 2 – Big Bus, Big Sights, and Gluten-Free Pizza
Our first full day in London began with figuring out the Tube — a small but satisfying triumph that made the rest of the city feel within reach. We made our way to the starting point of our Big Bus tour and climbed aboard, ready to take in the sights. After snapping photos from the open top deck, we hopped off at Whitehall and walked toward Big Ben. Standing beneath the clock tower was surreal, especially with the towering Palace of Westminster stretching out beside it — one of the most stunning examples of gothic architecture we’ve ever seen. Just across the Thames, the London Eye slowly turned, offering a modern contrast to the historic skyline. From there, we boarded the river cruise that came with our tour, giving us a fresh view of London’s landmarks from the water. It dropped us near the Tower of London, where we explored the grounds and took photos near Tower Bridge’s soaring spans. What stood out most today was the architecture — grand, detailed, and unforgettable. For Molly, the highlight was getting her picture next to the royal guards on horseback — until it was topped by a Harry Potter walking tour, where she got to see filming locations and hidden corners that brought the magic of the movies to life. We ended the day with a cozy dinner at Bella Italia, where Molly got to enjoy gluten-free pizza — a well-earned treat after miles of walking and wizardry.

## Day 3 – Royals, Redcoats, and Rolling with It
We started the day at Trafalgar Square, ready for our scheduled Royal Walking Tour — but after some waiting and watching, it became clear the guide wasn’t going to show. Not ones to waste a day, we navigated our way toward Buckingham Palace to see the Changing of the Guard on our own. Unfortunately, that too was cancelled for the day — but the palace was still an impressive sight, and we managed to get some great photos in front of its iconic gates. From there, we spent the rest of the day exploring more of London’s neighborhoods and hopping back on the Big Bus Tour to see the parts of the city we’d missed the day before. Even with a few bumps in the plan, it turned into a full and memorable day — proof that in London, there’s always something to see, whether or not the guards are marching.

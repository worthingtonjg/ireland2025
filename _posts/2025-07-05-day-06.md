## Ring of Kerry Tour
The Ring of Kerry bus tour was a breathtaking journey through some of Ireland’s most iconic landscapes. We saw dramatic coastlines, winding mountain roads, peaceful lakes, and charming villages along the way. Our guide filled the trip with local stories and history, pointing out everything from ancient stone forts to the a village who had a goat as king. We stopped often to take in panoramic views, and snap photos. 

## Exploring Killarney
After the tour, we spent time walking around the town of Killarney. The lively streets were full of shops, restaurants, and traditional pubs, but we also found quieter corners to enjoy. We strolled through the peaceful town park and visited the impressive St. Mary’s Cathedral, whose Gothic architecture stood out beautifully against the greenery. The relaxed pace of the evening gave us time to reflect on the day’s sights and enjoy the charm of Killarney before heading back to rest for the night.

Today we took the train from Mullingar to Dublin for a day filled with sightseeing, history, surprises, and sweets. We packed a lot in — from amphibious vehicles to crypts, cathedrals to castles — and ended the day with gelato before catching the evening train back.

## Viking Splash Tour
We kicked off our Dublin adventure with the Viking Splash Tour — a loud, hilarious, and surprisingly informative ride through the city. Riding in an amphibious WWII-style DUKW vehicle, we toured the streets while wearing Viking helmets and roaring at pedestrians. Our guide mixed history with humor, and the splashdown into the canal was a fun twist. It was a perfect way to get our bearings in the city while having some serious fun.

After the tour, we took a break in a nearby park. Just as things were feeling calm and relaxed, I got smacked in the head by a rogue seagull swooping in at full speed. Whether it mistook my hair for food or just didn’t like my vibe, we’ll never know — but it definitely added some chaos and laughter to the day.

## St. Patrick’s Cathedral
Our next stop was the majestic St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Ireland’s national cathedral. Inside, the vaulted ceilings, intricate stained glass, and rows of historical memorials created a quiet, reverent contrast to our wild Viking start. We walked slowly through the nave, taking in the stories of Irish history woven into the art and architecture. Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver’s Travels, is buried here, and we paused by his grave to pay our respects.

## Stained Glass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral  
One of the most striking features of St. Patrick’s Cathedral was the stained glass. The windows were rich in color, detail, and story — each one capturing scenes from scripture, Irish history, or commemorating individuals from centuries past. The light filtering through cast vibrant reflections across the stone floor, adding a warm, almost reverent glow to the entire space. We spent extra time simply standing and admiring the artistry, trying to take in the intricate patterns and vivid expressions. It was easily one of the most beautiful examples of stained glass we’ve seen on this trip — both visually stunning and spiritually moving.

## St. Michan’s Church and Mummies
From there, we made our way to St. Michan’s Church, one of Dublin’s hidden gems. Beneath the unassuming exterior lies a network of crypts that hold naturally preserved mummies — including a crusader, a nun, and several anonymous bodies. The cool, dry air and limestone vaults have helped preserve them for hundreds of years. Seeing exposed bones and skin in real life was both eerie and unforgettable.

## Christ Church Cathedral and Dublin Castle 
We ended our walking tour with a stroll past Christ Church Cathedral and the grounds of Dublin Castle. Though we didn’t go inside, we admired the contrast between the medieval Record Tower and the more refined Georgian buildings that now house government offices.

# Streets of Dublin and Cloud 9 Gelato
Before heading back to the station, we treated ourselves to Cloud 9 Gelato — a colorful little shop with delicious options. After so much walking, the gelato was a perfect final reward before catching our train back to Mullingar.

title: "Day 12 - Carrick-a-Rede, Giants Causeway and Dark Hedges"
date: 2025-07-11

Today we explored some of the most breathtaking and famous sites in Northern Ireland — crossing the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, hiking across the otherworldly basalt formations of the Giant’s Causeway, and finishing the day under the haunting, tunnel-like canopy of the Dark Hedges. Our visit happened to fall on July 11th, the eve of a major Northern Irish holiday known as the Twelfth. Along the way, we saw massive towers of wooden pallets being prepared for bonfires and were advised to avoid Belfast later in the evening due to potential tensions or large gatherings. Taking that advice to heart, we made sure to pass through early and continued on to the coast for a full day of adventure and scenery.

## Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge
Our first stop was Carrick-a-Rede, where we crossed the narrow rope bridge suspended nearly 100 feet above the sea, connecting the mainland to a tiny island once used by fishermen. The views were incredible — jagged cliffs, turquoise water, and seabirds wheeling through the air — but the bridge itself was thrilling and just a little nerve-wracking. The wind added a bit of sway, but we all made it across (and back!) with a mix of nervous laughter and awe.

## Giant’s Causeway
From there, we headed to the legendary Giant’s Causeway, one of the most unique natural wonders in the world. Thousands of interlocking hexagonal basalt columns stretched out toward the sea like a giant’s puzzle, formed by ancient volcanic activity — or, as legend has it, by the giant Finn McCool. We climbed over the rocks, admired the wave-battered shoreline, and took time to appreciate the beauty and mystery of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## The Dark Hedges
We ended the day with a visit to The Dark Hedges, a quiet country lane lined with twisted, ancient beech trees. Made famous by Game of Thrones, the road felt magical and eerie as the trees arched overhead, creating a natural tunnel of branches. In the soft evening light, with barely anyone else around, it was easy to imagine we’d stepped into a fairytale — or a ghost story.

## Eleventh Night
We made the drive north on July 11th, which is a significant date in Northern Ireland known as the Eleventh Night. It marks the eve of the Twelfth of July, a Protestant celebration commemorating the Battle of the Boyne. As we traveled, we passed several enormous bonfires made of stacked wooden pallets — some towering over buildings — ready to be lit that night. We were advised by locals to avoid Belfast in the evening due to potential unrest or heavy crowds related to the celebrations. Taking their advice seriously, we made sure to get through the area earlier in the day and steer clear of any tensions. It was a fascinating glimpse into a complex part of Northern Ireland’s cultural and political identity.

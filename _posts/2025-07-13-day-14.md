Today was a slower, more restful Sunday. We attended church again in Mullingar, made a new connection with two fellow members, and later returned to the Bloomfield Abbey Gardens for a peaceful lunch.

## Sunday at Church  
We attended the Mullingar branch again this morning, and after the meeting we offered a ride to two members who were planning to take the bus and train home. They were from Nigeria, and during the drive we had a great time talking and getting to know them. It was a simple act of service that turned into a meaningful conversation, and it reminded us of the warmth and diversity of the Church around the world. Their stories and kindness left a lasting impression on us.

## Return to Abby Bloom Gardens  
After dropping them off, we returned home to rest for a bit, then took a walk back to the **Abbey Bloom Botanical Gardens** for a quiet lunch. The gardens were just as peaceful and beautiful as we remembered from our earlier visit. Surrounded by flowers, hedges, and soft summer light, it was the perfect spot to reflect, relax, and enjoy the simplicity of a Sunday afternoon.

## Sleeping in the Irish Hedge üåø

One of the most unusual and fun experiences on this trip has been camping in the hedge behind our VRBO. The property is surrounded by tall, dense hedgerows that provide a surprising amount of shelter and privacy. I decided to set up my hammock in a tucked-away spot and spent two nights sleeping outdoors, wrapped in greenery.

The first night was calm and peaceful, with the rustle of leaves and occasional distant owl hoots adding to the atmosphere. The second night, I slept even better ‚Äî it felt like having my own secluded campsite just steps from the house. It was a simple way to enjoy the Irish countryside in a completely different way, and something I‚Äôll definitely remember long after the trip ends.

Our first stop in Ireland was the beautiful Belvedere House and Gardens, located just outside Mullingar in County Westmeath. Set on the shores of Lough Ennell, this 18th-century estate offered a peaceful and scenic start to our journey. We explored the grand Georgian villa, wandered through the Victorian walled gardens, and strolled the woodland trails past ornate follies — including the dramatic "Jealous Wall," Ireland’s largest man-made ruin. It was the perfect blend of nature, history, and architecture to kick off our 30-day adventure.

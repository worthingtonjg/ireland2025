title: "Day 16 - Craggaunowen and Bunratty"

Today we visited two heritage sites that brought ancient Ireland to life — **Craggaunowen**, a living history park focused on prehistoric and early Christian Ireland, and **Bunratty Castle**, a fully restored medieval fortress. While both were interesting, I personally enjoyed Craggaunowen more for its immersive, hands-on atmosphere and the memorable people we met along the way.

## Craggaunowen  
Craggaunowen was a highlight of the trip. The park features reconstructed crannógs (lake dwellings), Iron Age huts, and a ring fort, all nestled into forested paths and peaceful surroundings. What made it especially memorable was one of the reenactors — a man performing primitive throat singing and playing a handmade bagpipe carved from animal horn. It was strange and mesmerizing, and it really added a sense of authenticity and ancient atmosphere to the place. We even got to crawl through a series of small caves beneath one of the mounds, which added an element of adventure to the historical exploration. The site felt genuinely alive, as if we’d stepped back in time.

## Bunratty Castle  
Later in the day, we visited **Bunratty Castle and Folk Park**, a much larger and more polished attraction. The castle itself is fully restored and furnished, with winding staircases, grand halls, and battlements you can climb for great views. Surrounding the castle is a recreated 19th-century village, complete with shops, cottages, and a working pub. It was interesting to see, but after the raw and personal experience at Craggaunowen, Bunratty felt more staged by comparison. Still, it was impressive in scale and detail, and a worthwhile stop as we continued our journey through Ireland’s past.

title: "Day 22 - Bus Tour ~ Hill of Tara, Knowth, Newgrange"
date: 2025-07-22
---

From the quiet tracks of Mullingar to the ancient heart of Ireland, we stepped back thousands of years in a single day. A train carried us to Dublin, where a winding bus route took us through the lush, storied countryside to three of Ireland’s most sacred sites. The Hill of Tara, Knowth, and Newgrange each unfolded like a chapter of a forgotten book — filled with kings, tombs, and sunlit mysteries. Below, you’ll find glimpses into places where time bends and legends live on.

## Hill of Tara

Once the seat of Ireland’s High Kings, the Hill of Tara is more than just grassy mounds and buried stone. It’s a place where power, myth, and ceremony collided. From the Lia Fáil — the “Stone of Destiny” said to cry out under the rightful king — to the ring forts and barrows that still ripple across the landscape, Tara whispers of sovereignty and the unseen. Many believe it to be a portal to the otherworld, guarded by ancient energies still humming beneath the earth.

## Knowth

Knowth is a landscape of passage tombs — 20 mounds clustered around one great cairn, older than Stonehenge and the pyramids. The main tomb is richly engraved with Neolithic art, its swirling stones hinting at mysteries we still don’t fully understand. Long forgotten and then rediscovered, Knowth speaks to a society that honored its dead with architecture, astronomy, and awe. The orientation of its chambers shows the builders’ deep connection to the stars and seasons.

## Newgrange

Newgrange is Ireland’s crown jewel of prehistory — a 5,000-year-old passage tomb designed with stunning precision. Every winter solstice, sunlight pierces the roof box and travels down the stone corridor to illuminate the inner chamber, just as it has for millennia. Covered in white quartz and megalithic art, it’s both tomb and temple, mystery and miracle. Walking inside is like stepping into eternity — a space untouched by time yet pulsing with ancient purpose.

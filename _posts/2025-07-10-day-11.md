Today we visited Birr Castle and its incredible science-focused gardens, followed by a hike to Glenbarrow Waterfall in the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The drive to the falls was an adventure in itself, with narrow winding roads that kept us on edge — but the destination was well worth it.

## Birr Castle
Birr Castle was a fascinating mix of history, science, and beauty. The grounds feature lush gardens, quiet walking paths, and one of the largest trees in Ireland — but the real highlight was the castle’s connection to scientific discovery. In the 1800s, the Third Earl of Rosse built what was then the largest telescope in the world right there on the estate. We explored the interactive science museum, saw the massive Leviathan telescope, and learned about the family’s contributions to astronomy and photography. It was a refreshing change from the typical castle experience — less about royalty, more about curiosity and innovation.

## Glenbarrow Waterfall
Reaching Glenbarrow Waterfall was a bit of a challenge. The final stretch of road was extremely narrow and twisting, with barely enough room for one car and sheer drop-offs in places — a nerve-wracking drive that required full focus. Once we arrived, though, the stress melted away. The hike to the waterfall took us through peaceful forests and alongside a rushing river, eventually leading to the falls cascading over moss-covered rocks. It was a quiet, natural contrast to the structured gardens of Birr, and a perfect place to unwind and take in Ireland’s raw, wild beauty.

## Blarney Castle & Gardens
Blarney Castle is one of Ireland’s most iconic landmarks, and it didn’t disappoint. The castle itself, with its steep stone steps and panoramic views from the top, was impressive — but the highlight was watching Jana lean backward over the edge to kiss the legendary Blarney Stone. She officially earned the gift of eloquence, while the rest of us were happy to stay firmly upright. The castle’s history and dramatic structure made it one of the more exciting stops on our journey so far.

After touring the castle, we spent the rest of the day wandering the expansive and beautifully designed gardens. From the Poison Garden filled with deadly plants, to the tranquil fern-filled woodlands and reflective water features, every path led to something new and unexpected. The grounds were lush and peaceful, with plenty of places to rest, explore, and take in the natural beauty. It was the perfect place to slow down, stretch our legs, and enjoy a more relaxed pace after several busy travel days.

  <em>Blarney Castle, built nearly 600 years ago by the powerful MacCarthy clan, is best known for the legendary Blarney Stone—said to bestow the “gift of gab” on those brave enough to kiss it. But there’s far more to explore beyond the battlements. The castle’s extensive gardens are steeped in stories of druids, witches, and fairies, with ancient stones and enchanted glens hinting at Ireland’s mystical past. From the Witch’s Stone to the Druid’s Cave, each path we walked is rooted in folklore. The captions below trace both the historical facts and the legends that still linger in the shadows of the castle walls and garden groves.</em>

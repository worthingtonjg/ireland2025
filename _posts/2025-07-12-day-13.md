Today was a castle-packed day as we traveled through the heart of Ireland and visited three incredible historic sites: **Cahir Castle**, the iconic **Rock of Cashel**, and the grand **Kilkenny Castle**. Each location offered a different perspective on Ireland’s medieval and aristocratic past — from military strongholds to religious ruins and noble estates.

## Cahir Castle  
Our first stop was **Cahir Castle**, one of Ireland’s best-preserved medieval fortresses. Built on a rocky island in the River Suir, the castle felt like something straight out of a movie — with towers, battlements, and a working portcullis. We explored the defensive walls, climbed up spiral staircases, and watched an excellent video exhibit inside that explained how the castle changed hands over centuries of Irish conflict. It was a solid start to our day of castles and set the tone for the historical weight of the journey.

## Rock of Cashel  
Next, we visited the **Rock of Cashel**, one of the most iconic landmarks in Ireland. Perched on a limestone hill overlooking the countryside, this dramatic ruin was once the seat of kings and bishops. We walked through the remains of the cathedral, the round tower, and Cormac’s Chapel, taking in sweeping views in every direction. The weathered stone structures against the open sky made it feel like a place suspended between earth and heaven — rich with spiritual and historical significance.

## Kilkenny Castle  
Our final stop was **Kilkenny Castle**, a striking blend of medieval foundations and later Victorian remodeling. The inside of the castle was beautifully restored, giving us a glimpse into the luxurious lives of the Butler family who lived there for centuries. We strolled through richly decorated rooms, long picture galleries, and perfectly manicured gardens. Kilkenny itself was a lively and charming town, and visiting the castle there provided a fitting, elegant close to a long and castle-filled day.

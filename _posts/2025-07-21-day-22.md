Molly wasn't feeling up to doing anything today, so we left her home but stayed local.  We visited the Cathedral Christ is King in Mullingar, but there was a funeral in session.  We heard the bells ring, which was beautiful.  We then drove to Lough Owel, Donore Wood for some walking and then made a stop at Lough Derravaragh.

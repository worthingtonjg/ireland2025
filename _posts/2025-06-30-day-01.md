Our adventure begins.  Today we leave for our month long trip to Ireland!

I worked until noon today and then left for the Salt Lake City airport.  My wife's friends daughter dropped us off.

Molly was super excited and nervous to fly.  We got to the airport a bit early and had to wait.

Excited for what lies ahead!

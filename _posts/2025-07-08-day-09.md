title: "Day 9 - Trim and Maynooth Castles"

Today we explored two impressive castles: the massive Norman stronghold of Trim Castle and the quieter, but still fascinating, ruins of Maynooth Castle. Each offered a unique perspective on Ireland’s medieval history and made for a day full of stone towers, winding staircases, and echoes of the past.

## Trim Castle
We began the day at Trim Castle, the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland. The site is expansive and dramatic, with a towering keep and thick curtain walls that dominate the surrounding landscape. We joined a guided tour that took us inside the keep, where we climbed narrow staircases and looked out from high battlements. The guide shared stories of sieges, medieval life, and film trivia — since the castle was famously used in Braveheart. Exploring the grounds afterward gave us time to admire the scale of the ruins and imagine what life might have been like within those massive walls.

## Maynooth Castle
In the afternoon, we visited Maynooth Castle, a smaller but historically significant site. Once the seat of the powerful Fitzgerald family, the castle has a more compact footprint, but the remaining tower and gatehouse are still impressive. The visitor center inside gave us helpful context about the family’s influence and the castle’s role in Irish politics and uprisings. Though quieter and less grand than Trim, Maynooth had its own charm — a more personal and reflective visit that balanced the intensity of the morning’s fortress.

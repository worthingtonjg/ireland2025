Perched high on the hills of County Meath, the Loughcrew Cairns are among the oldest known structures in Ireland—older even than the pyramids of Egypt. These Neolithic passage tombs, scattered across rolling slopes, form a sacred landscape built by ancient hands over 5,000 years ago. The most prominent, Cairn T, is perfectly aligned with the rising sun on the spring and autumn equinoxes, when sunlight pierces the narrow passage and illuminates the carvings within.

## Loughcrew Cairns  
Walking among these cairns, we weren’t just sightseeing—we were stepping into prehistory. The wind was strong, the hills quiet, and the sense of age almost overwhelming. Spirals, suns, and stars etched into stone still whisper of a people who understood the sky and honored their dead with remarkable precision. It was a humbling, spiritual place—raw and wild, yet deeply human.

After exploring the ancient tombs of Loughcrew, we made an unexpected but fitting stop at Apache Pizza in Mullingar. The name alone reminded us of home—Utah—and stepping inside only deepened the connection. The walls were decorated with images of desert landscapes, red rock canyons, and mesas that looked like they were pulled straight from Monument Valley. It felt surreal to see familiar southwestern scenery so far from the American West, tucked into a cozy Irish pizza shop. The food was hot, the service friendly, and the atmosphere oddly comforting—a little taste of Utah in the heart of Ireland.

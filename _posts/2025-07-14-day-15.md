We spent the day exploring the Wicklow region, uncovering a mix of hidden gems and iconic historic sites. From the strange and solitary Wicklow Pyramid to the seaside ruins of Black Castle and the serene monastic valley of Glendalough, each stop gave us a different glimpse into Ireland’s rich and varied past. Molly decided to stay home and rest today, so we adventured without her — but we made sure to grab a photo of us eating ice cream to tease her for missing out.

## Wicklow Pyramid (Howard Mausoleum)  
Our first stop was the **Wicklow Pyramid**, also known as the **Howard Mausoleum**. Tucked away in a quiet graveyard near the village of Killincarrig, this unexpected structure looks like it belongs more in Egypt than rural Ireland. Built in the 18th century by the Howard family, the pyramid serves as a family tomb and stands out starkly among the surrounding gravestones. It was eerie, fascinating, and completely unique — a great reminder of how even lesser-known places in Ireland can surprise you.

## Black Castle & Wicklow
Next, we visited **Black Castle** in Wicklow Town. Perched on a rocky headland overlooking the Irish Sea, the castle ruins are all that remain of a Norman fortress destroyed in the 14th century. Though only crumbling stone walls are left, the views were spectacular — waves crashing against the cliffs below, with the breeze carrying the smell of salt and seaweed. The dramatic coastal setting made it easy to imagine the site as it once was, guarding the coast centuries ago.

## Glendalough Monastic Site  
We finished the day at the stunning **Glendalough Monastic Site**, nestled in a glacial valley in the Wicklow Mountains. Founded by St. Kevin in the 6th century, the site includes a round tower, stone churches, and ancient grave markers scattered among trees and grassy meadows. We walked the trails along the lake, took in the peaceful atmosphere, and felt the quiet reverence that still lingers in the ruins. Glendalough was the perfect way to end the day — timeless, spiritual, and surrounded by nature.

title: "Day 19 - Aillwee Burren Caves, Birds of Prey, Cliffs of Moher"
date: 2025-07-18
---

Today was packed with adventure, beginning deep underground and ending high above the sea. We started at the Aillwee Burren Caves, flew with falcons at the Birds of Prey Centre, and sampled cheese and fudge from the valley below. From there, we made our way to the breathtaking Cliffs of Moher—one of Ireland’s most iconic natural wonders—before making an impromptu stop at the quiet, haunting ruins of Kilmacduagh Monastery. The day closed with a perfect slice of cheesecake from Weir’s Restaurant, handmade by Una herself—easily the best cheesecake we’ve had on this trip.

## Aillwee Burren Caves  
Our day began beneath the limestone hills of the Burren at the Aillwee Caves—one of the largest caves in Ireland. Guided through dark tunnels, we passed underground waterfalls, eerie rock formations, and the skeletal remains of a long-extinct bear. The chill and silence of the cave made the experience feel both ancient and mysterious, like stepping into a hidden world untouched for millennia.

## Birds of Prey Centre  
Back above ground, we explored the Birds of Prey Centre next door, where eagles, hawks, falcons, and owls soared and swooped during the flying demonstration. It was a thrilling show of precision and power, with handlers sharing fascinating facts about each bird. Seeing these majestic creatures up close—and watching them glide just inches overhead—was one of the most unforgettable parts of the day.

## Cliffs of Moher  
From there, we traveled to the windswept Cliffs of Moher, where dramatic sea views stretched endlessly in both directions. Towering above the Atlantic, the cliffs felt impossibly vast—especially as gusts of wind threatened to steal our breath (and our hats). Despite the crowds, the experience still felt deeply personal, standing at the edge of the island and looking out toward the horizon.

## Kilmacduagh Monastery Ruins  
Our final stop before dinner was a spontaneous one: the haunting ruins of Kilmacduagh Monastery. The round tower, still standing tall, watches over crumbling stone churches and ancient graves. The place was nearly empty and eerily quiet, with only the wind and the crows for company. It was the perfect contrast to the busy cliffs—a hidden gem that felt like stumbling into history.

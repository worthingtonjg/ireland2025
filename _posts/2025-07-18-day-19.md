title: "Day 19 - Aillwee Burren Caves, Birds of Prey, Cliffs of Moher"
date: 2025-07-18
---

Today was packed with adventure, beginning deep underground and ending high above the sea. We started at the Aillwee Burren Caves, flew with falcons at the Birds of Prey Centre, and sampled cheese and fudge from the valley below. From there, we made our way to the breathtaking Cliffs of Moher—one of Ireland’s most iconic natural wonders—before making an impromptu stop at the quiet, haunting ruins of Kilmacduagh Monastery. The day closed with a perfect slice of cheesecake from Weir’s Restaurant, handmade by Una herself—easily the best cheesecake we’ve had on this trip.

## Aillwee Burren Caves  
Our day began beneath the limestone hills of the Burren at the Aillwee Caves—one of the most visited caves in Ireland. Guided through dark tunnels, we passed underground waterfalls, eerie rock formations, and the skeletal remains of a long-extinct bear. The chill and silence of the cave made the experience feel both ancient and mysterious, like stepping into a hidden world untouched for millennia.

The Aillwee Burren Caves extend approximately 300 meters (about 1,000 feet) into the heart of the mountain and reach a depth of around 30 meters (98 feet) below the surface at their deepest accessible point. While it's not the largest cave system in Ireland, its geological features and accessible pathways make it one of the most visited and well-preserved.

  <em>Hidden beneath the stark beauty of the Burren lies Aillwee Cave — a place carved by water and time. Once shelter for bears and refuge for early humans, its dark chambers now echo with stories of ancient geology, forgotten creatures, and the silent power of the earth. In the captions below, follow our descent into this subterranean world and uncover the wonders beneath the limestone.</em>

## Birds of Prey Centre  
Back above ground, we explored the Birds of Prey Centre next door, where eagles, hawks, falcons, and owls soared and swooped during the flying demonstration. It was a thrilling show of precision and power, with handlers sharing fascinating facts about each bird. Seeing these majestic creatures up close—and watching them glide just inches overhead—was one of the most unforgettable parts of the day.

  <em>High in the Burren hills, the Birds of Prey Centre brings ancient skies to life. Here, falcons, hawks, owls, and eagles soar just overhead — their silent wings and sharp eyes a living link to Ireland’s wild heart and deep-rooted falconry traditions. The captions below trace our experience among these majestic birds and the stories they carry on the wind.</em>

## Cheese and Fudge Tasting  
After the flight display, we visited the farm shop at the foot of the hill for a sampling of Aillwee’s famous cheeses and house-made fudge. While “tasting” may be putting it lightly—we made several enthusiastic rounds—it was a flavorful way to connect with local tradition. The cheese was sharp and creamy, and the fudge was sweet enough to demand restraint we didn’t have.

## Cliffs of Moher  
From there, we traveled to the windswept Cliffs of Moher, where dramatic sea views stretched endlessly in both directions. Towering above the Atlantic, the cliffs felt impossibly vast—especially as gusts of wind threatened to steal our breath (and our hats). Despite the crowds, the experience still felt deeply personal, standing at the edge of the island and looking out toward the horizon.

  <em>The Cliffs of Moher rise like a jagged wall from the Atlantic, timeless and untamed. Legends speak of lost lovers and magical sea creatures, while the cliffs themselves have starred in films from *Harry Potter* to *The Princess Bride*. Each caption below offers a glimpse into the wild beauty, myth, and cinematic fame that make this one of Ireland’s most iconic places.</em>

## Kilmacduagh Monastery Ruins  
Our final stop before dinner was a spontaneous one: the haunting ruins of Kilmacduagh Monastery. The round tower, still standing tall, watches over crumbling stone churches and ancient graves. The place was nearly empty and eerily quiet, with only the wind and the crows for company. It was the perfect contrast to the busy cliffs—a hidden gem that felt like stumbling into history.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px; background: #f9f9f9; margin-bottom: 2em;">
  <em>Amid quiet fields, the ruins of Kilmacduagh whisper of saints and stone. Founded by Saint Colman in the 7th century, this sacred site once thrived with prayer and learning. Its leaning round tower and crumbling cloisters invite you to step into Ireland’s spiritual past. As you read the captions below, let the ancient stones speak of monastic life, legend, and the enduring peace of this holy place.</em>

We returned to Dublin by train for another day of culture and storytelling. The highlights were a visit to Trinity College to see the famous Book of Kells, followed by a fun and imaginative trip to the Leprechaun Museum, which turned out to be more about Irish folklore than gold and rainbows.

## Book of Kells at Trinity College
Our first stop was Trinity College, where we toured the exhibit featuring the Book of Kells — an illuminated manuscript created by monks over 1,200 years ago. The exhibit explained the history, symbolism, and artistry behind the book, and seeing the actual pages on display was awe-inspiring. Afterward, we walked through the stunning Long Room of the Old Library, with its endless rows of antique books and busts of famous thinkers. The scent of aged paper and polished wood gave the space a timeless, almost sacred feeling.

## Leprechaun Museum
In the afternoon, we visited the National Leprechaun Museum, which turned out to be less of a tourist gimmick and more of a deep dive into Ireland’s mythological past. The museum focuses on Irish fairy tales, legends, and oral storytelling traditions. Our guide led us through darkened rooms, oversized furniture, and surreal settings while telling old stories about fairies, changelings, and mischievous spirits. It was immersive, theatrical, and fun — a reminder that Ireland’s history isn’t just in its castles and books, but in the magic of its stories too.

Sundays are always pleasant. We sleep in a bit and take our time getting ready. Enjoy a bit of breakfast. We had told Pat that we would be happy to answer some questions about our stay and visits today before church, but we could not find him this morning. Pat and Una seem to be two of the busiest people I have ever met. And they know everyone. 

Yesterday when we were at the Hill of Uisneach the guide asked us where we were staying. When we said Multyfarnham she replied with, “Oh they have the best restaurant there, have you been to Weirs?” We get that from almost everyone we talk to, as soon as we mention Multifarnham, we are told about the Weir’s Restaurant. I love it, what a great way to bring it all back to where we are staying. 

Church was enjoyable and it was a little sad for me to know we will not get to come back to the branch meeting again before going home. The people are kind and inviting. Even today Daisy invited us for dinner this week. It was so nice of her. They are the only family in the branch that live in Multyfarnham, she even used to work for Pat and Una. Unfortunately Jonathan has to work in the evenings, so dinner would be hard. I think I might message Daisy and ask her if they want to join us on one of our sightseeing adventures this week.

After we got home from church we had lunch and then enjoyed a bit of relaxing. Molly practices some writing, we are trying to keep our skills active for school in the fall. Then we took the second round of cheesecake plates back to the restaurant.

Good Morning! I am a little more rested, but this trip is taking all of my energy and regaining any feels short lived. But, we don;t want to waste another day, so we go out, but keep it light. 

Today we are visiting Loughcrew Cairns. It is a megalithic site. We decided to self tour this site instead of paying for a tour guide. The weather is rainy today, but we brought our rain coats, so we are ready for it. The drive today is between 30-40 minutes, which isn’t too bad now that we are better at choosing alternate routes and avoiding unnecessary time on narrow local roads.

The walk from the car park to the site is mostly uphill. The rain is light and the temperature is lovely. The views of the countryside as we walk is incredible. The Cairns are interesting, but not overly impressive. They are said to be the prehistoric ruins of clans that built underground strongholds. The main hilltop is still intact, but it is gated and you can’t see inside. The smaller cairns are caved in from the top, so they look like a circle of stones that you can tell were put in place deliberately, but the function of such a small structure seems odd. We took some good pictures and enjoyed the walk. There was a very neat staircase in the trees that lead to the trail, it looked so mythical. I love all of the greenery and vegetation everywhere. 

After we got back to the car we decided to go into Mullingar and get lunch on the way home. So Molly and I took Jonathan to Apache Pizza. Another gluten free pizza for Molly, burger and taco fries for mom and dad. Just a slow and easy day. We stopped at the market for a few groceries and went home. Tomorrow we have a longer day, so we kept today light.

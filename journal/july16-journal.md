## July 16

Last night my allergies kicked in a bit, my nose is all runny and I have the sneezes. Also, we are out of toilet paper. So first thing this morning, I drove into Mullingar to buy toilet paper. 

We are at a bit of a loss today. We did our scheduled tour of Bunratty yesterday, so we have no plans for today. After some thought, we decided to take the day for rest and documentation. Jonathan has been working all day on a blog of our trip so far, I have been journaling our adventure, and Molly has been a classic teenager. She has spent the day watching videos on her phone and playing in the yard with Poppy. We all took a walk to the park together before lunch. Pat and Una have been off on a fishing trip the last two days and their friend has been in and out looking after Poppy. The dog loves to stand at the glass door of our rental and paws like a soft knock for Molly to come out and play. So, we took Poppy on our walk with us and let her splash in the river for a while. There is a zipline at the park and Molly got to use some energy. The weather was very pleasant and the walk was relaxing. Now back to work in writing down all we have done and seen, I really should have done better at this from day one.

At dinner time Molly asked if we could find a place that makes gluten free pizza. So she and I drove into Mullingar and got food at Apache Pizza. They had a wall painting of the red rock cliffs in Utah! We got Molly a GF cheese pizza, Jonathan a big cheese burger, and I got taco fries. We now have a new favorite food place, it was so yummy. I will have to ask some of the members at church if they have tried Apache pizza yet.

Today we were off to the Hill of Uisneach, a megalithic site. It was less than 30 minutes away so we had an easy morning, made breakfast, and did not rush. We got there in good time and easily found a spot in the car park. It was just a short walk from the car to the small visitor center. 

The tour guide was already there and chatting with some of the other visitors. We walked around the small center and read about the history and significance of the site. Then the guide called the group together and pointed out our expected route on a large display may. She explained a little of the importance of the site, this being the center of Ireland, and the middle of 5 regions, and that from the top of the hill you could see like 20 different counties. 

She shared her interpretation of a few more maps and surveyors ideas of why this location was key to leadership and unity throughout different periods of history. Then she led us on a walk up the path and around the hillsides, past fairy trees, a pond, a unique rock formation, and an interesting piece of art integrated into the side of a large tree trunk that looked like a woman’s face. The tour started around 11am and we got back to the visitor center around 1:30pm. 

It was a long walk, but the weather was lovely and it didn’t really rain on us. The grass was very wet from last night's rain though so our shoes, socks, and feet were all soggy. We did get some very good pictures, and she told us some interesting stories. 

We decided to go get some lunch after our tour. We drove into Mullingar and found a Supermacs, like a fast food burger place. It was nice to sit and enjoy lunch after such a long walk. After we got home, Molly and I grabbed the bottles and cans. They charge a fee for these and give you a refund credit if you recycle them. We went to the store, recycled our used ones, and bought a few groceries.  

Back at our rental we made dinner and worked on journaling our experiences. Then I remembered that I had to take back the plates from the cheesecake we got in the restaurant last night. As I walked out the door, Jonathan said” get more cheesecake”. I laughed. I walked into the restaurant and told one of the girls working that my cheesecake plates were sadly empty. She also laughed, and asked if I wanted more. “Two pieces please”. I don’t think we really needed cheesecake, but it was just so tasty, how could I pass up another piece, plus, we had walked a lot today, so I felt I’d earned the treat.

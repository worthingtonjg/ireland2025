Sunday is our down day. We go to church at 11am, so we don’t have to rush to get up. The district here is very welcoming, but also very small. They don’t have a young women's group so Molly went with me to Relief Society. There was a total of six of us in the room, we had a pleasant lesson and nice conversations after class. It was a very low stress situation. After church Jonathan offered a ride home for two of the members that were going to walk to the train station. I was impressed at their dedication and desire to go to church even though getting there took a long time to walk, take a train, and walk some more. We enjoyed chatting with them as we drove them to different towns. 

When we got home we took another Sunday walk to the Botanical garden. The walk is so lovely and the gardens are very peaceful. We bought a snack at the cafe and sat in the shade for a while. Then we walked home, we had a video call with Manin and her Family at 4pm, and we didn’t want to miss it. We had a very nice conversation with Manon’s family. It is evident that they are quite different from Rieke’s family. I think they are a bit more easy going. They struggled more with English, but helped each other and giggled as they tried to effectively communicate with us. I was impressed that they did so well, we know zero french, so it really was all on them to try to speak english. 

The rest of the day we are going to try to rest and create a blog of our trip so far. If we can organize pictures and add commentary, it will give us a better memory of our time in Ireland.

## July 4

It was an early morning today! We are going to Blarney castle. Maybe even kiss the blarney stone. But we have to drive 3 hours to get there. So rise and grumble, then get in the car. 

Ok, we survived the harrowing drive to Blarney, I don’t think I will ever get used to the narrow roads here. 

Wow, Blarney is huge. The grounds are so green and the castle is very impressive. It is not a renovated, live-in castle. Blarney is a restored, historical site. There was a visitor center, with info plaques on the history of the site and some of the famous people who have visited the property. Including Churchill and Laurel & Hardy, just to name the ones I remember. There are also a few theories about the origin of the Blarney stone.

After the visitor center, we walked towards the Castle. There was a path to some cave/underground tunnel, so we explored that. It was dark and damp, and didn’t go very far, but we suspect they went into the castle at some point in history.

The castle had a line to get in, but it only took us about a half hour to get through the doors. The inside was so cool. You could really visualize life inside. You could see where floors of wood would have divided levels, and where fireplaces would have warmed the space. The views out the windows were sweet, and the defense features, like the murder hole and arrow slits were still easy to see. 

We followed the line of people and went up, up, up through the castle, until we reached the roof. There it was, the battlement and the famous Blarney stone. Wait, what the heck! Why are people laying on their backs and bending over the side of a very tall castle? The blarney stone is set in the wall at the bottom of a ledge across from a walkway. Hard to picture, I know!. 

But to kiss the stone you lay on your back and grab on to iron rods above your head. Then a castle attendant grabs your waist and slides you out over the opening between the stone and the walkway. You are a bit upside down at this point and all of the blood is rushing to your head, so you are quickly getting dizzy. Stretch your neck and give that stone the quickest peck you’ve ever given, and get pulled back in. Sitting up, you feel the blood rush back to your body, and you move along so the next visitor can follow suit. How many germs did I just get? I put on about 10 layers of chapstick before I took my turn, in a vain attempt to buffer the contamination. Oh well, fingers crossed I got the luck and not the yuck from the Blarney stone. 

<em>Jonathan and Molly were supposed to go after me, but they both chickened out, what?!</em>

On to explore the grounds. They had a beautiful forested area, walking trails, gardens, flowers galore, a waterfall, and brooke, a Druid stone, and fairy garden. So much to see, and it was perfect weather, I prefer the overcast skies and cool breezes. We decided to take a little rest, so we stopped in the cafe. Jonathan got another toastie, I tried the irish stew, and Molly got chips to go with the sandwich we packed for her. We do not always find gluten free options, so we carry a plan B for her. After lunch we explored the Druid's cave, the wishing steps, and more garden trails. 

At some point in the gardens Jonathan and Molly kissed a Blarney garden stone, for luck? Not quite the same thing. 

We went into the gift shop on our way out, which coincidentally is the only way out. We got a few souvenirs and gifts. Now we face a three hour drive back to Multifarnham.

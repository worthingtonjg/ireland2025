## July 9

Ok, an early start to the day. We have to catch the 6:10am  train in Mullingar to get to Dublin in time for our Trinity College tour of the Book of Kells at 8:30am. It is a 20 minute walk from the train station to the college, and we have to be there 15 minutes before our tour. We got up at 5:15, in the car by 5:45, got to the Mullingar station by 6:03, and just made the train. It is a pleasant ride to the Connolly station in Dublin, but takes an hour and a half. The walk through Dublin feels pretty safe, lots of people and sights to see. The college campus had some construction so we had to walk around a bit to find the library. The tour was ok, but most of the books had been removed for preservation processing and it was a bit underwhelming. They also had a virtual reality experience, which was ok, but not what I was expecting. 

We had a tour of the National Leprechaun Museum scheduled for 10:30, but the walk over was only 15 minutes so we were early. This tour was very entertaining. The storyteller took us from room to room sharing expressive stories with decorated backdrops and some special effects art. It was fun, and some of the stories were goofy/disturbing. 

After the leprechaun Museum we had to book it back to the train station to catch the 1:05 train so we could be home before 4pm. We got to the train a bit early, thanks to quick walking, so we easily found seats together. However, at the first stop some lady came in and said she had reserved our seats for her family and that we had to move. We didn’t even know one could reserve seats, and we were a bit upset, what is the point of coming early to get seats together if someone can just take them from you, and by then the train was pretty full so we had to split up to find seats. Nevertheless, we made it home and Jonathan put in his hours for work. 
Tomorrow is another early day, but we won’t have to travel as far.
